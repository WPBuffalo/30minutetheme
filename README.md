# Building Your First Custom Theme
## Built for WordCamp Buffalo 2016

This is a theme based on the live-demo'ed theme at WordCamp Buffalo 2016. It is built to show that you can convert html "static" web pages into WordPress themes relatively easily.

### This Theme is meant to be simple for people new to WP Coding

There are more advanced functions that definitely make themes better, but we are purposely keeping this quite simple and rudimentary to not overwhelm people as they first view the theme files and code.


TO ADD TO SLIDEDECK:
- Disclaimer that this is a 'quick' theme
- Theme Template Hierarchy
- Front-Page.php
- Remove Date/Time from Front-page.php & Page.php
- Update Nav Menu Primary Location in its slide
- Add Widget/Sidebar register
- Conditional (if is front-page) for Banner Image - we don't need it on all pages
- Create page-sidebar-left & page-full-width and add custom css for them
- create images folder, copy images from our html site into it.
- profit!
